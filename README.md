# SudokuWebApp
Sudoku web application that allows the user to play a game of sudoku 

##Project Structure
1)  The assets folder contains two sub-folders named js and css(assets/js and assets/css). The hierarchy is explained below:

•	assets/js/sudokuApplication.js: It contains functions which are responsible for the behaviour of the application.

•	assets/css/styles.css: It contains code that describes the style of HTML document i.e. how the Sudoku applications html elements should be displayed.

2)	index.html: It contains the html code which is used to structure the web page. 

3)	sudoku.js: It contains the game logic. As suggested I have used the library at  https://github.com/robatron/sudoku.js for game logic.

##Frameworks/Tools

•	I used Bootstrap which is a HTML, CSS and JavaScript framework for developing responsive websites. It includes HTML and CSS based design templates which speeds up development of the product.  I chose Bootstrap because of following advantages:

o	It is easy to use

o	It has wide range of browser compatibility

o	It helps develop responsive websites

##Shortcuts

•	Currently user can’t choose level like easy, medium, hard 
•	The puzzle grid is static i.e it’s 9x9 for now

##Things I would do given unlimited time 

•	Developing the feature of different difficulty levels

•	Developing the variation of Sudoku like 6x6, 12x12

•	Enabling the solve puzzle feature so that computer can solve and show the right answer

•	Enabling help feature so that amateur can learn how to play

##Environment used to develop/test

•	I have used windows environment and Google Chrome browser for development and testing
